# Gemini Project Context: wskcrw

This file summarizes the context of the `wskcrw` project for future sessions.

## Project Overview

- **Project Name:** wskcrw
- **Type:** Web application with a rich text editor.
- **Core Technologies:** React, Vite, Lexical.
- **Main Goal:** To create a Notion-like script editor where users can insert and manage blocks of text that are editable.

## Development Summary & Current Status

We initially attempted to create an editable block by using a custom `DecoratorNode` (`ScriptBlockNode`) that rendered a `LexicalNestedComposer` inside a React component (`ScriptBlockComponent`).

**Problem Encountered:**
This approach led to persistent and hard-to-debug circular dependency issues. The application would crash with an `Element type is invalid... got: undefined` error when trying to render the custom node. This happened because the main editor, while initializing its nodes, triggered a dependency chain that looped back on itself, causing a failure in the module loading (specifically for the `ContentEditable` component).

**New Architectural Decision:**
After extensive debugging, we decided to **abandon the `LexicalNestedComposer` approach** due to its complexity and inherent issues with circular dependencies in our setup.

The new, simpler architecture will be:
1.  **Use a custom `ElementNode` as a container:** We will create a new `ScriptContainerNode` that extends `ElementNode`. Its sole purpose is to act as a styled wrapper (e.g., providing a border and background) for its children.
2.  **Use standard nodes for content:** The actual text content will be a standard `ParagraphNode` placed *inside* the `ScriptContainerNode`. 
3.  **Leverage the main editor:** All text editing will be handled natively by the main editor, as the content is just a regular paragraph. This completely eliminates the need for a nested editor, state synchronization, and the associated complexity.

## Implementation Summary & Resolution

Based on the new architectural decision, the following steps were taken to refactor the editor:

1.  **Initial Change:** The insertion logic in `scriptEditor.jsx` was temporarily modified to insert a standard `ParagraphNode` to quickly move away from the problematic custom node.
2.  **Code Cleanup:** The obsolete `ScriptBlockNode.jsx` and `ScriptBlockComponent.jsx` files, which were responsible for the nested editor approach, were deleted. All references to these components were removed from `Editor.jsx`.
3.  **New Node Implementation:** A new `ScriptContainerNode.jsx` was created. This node extends `ElementNode` and acts as a simple, non-editable, styled container for other nodes.
4.  **Editor Integration:** The new `ScriptContainerNode` was registered in the `Editor.jsx` configuration, and a theme was applied to give it a distinct visual style (background, padding, etc.).
5.  **Final Insertion Logic:** The logic in `scriptEditor.jsx` was updated to insert a `ScriptContainerNode` containing a `ParagraphNode` with the script's content. This completed the new architecture.

**Follow-up Bug Fix:**
- **Problem:** A new issue was identified where inserting a second block caused it to be indented inside the first block. 
- **Cause:** This was due to the editor's selection remaining *inside* the first container after insertion. The subsequent insertion was happening in a nested context, causing Lexical to auto-indent the new block.
- **Resolution:** The insertion logic was made more robust. It now explicitly finds the top-level block containing the cursor, 'escapes' it, and inserts the new block as a sibling, not a child. This definitively solves the nesting and indentation issue.
